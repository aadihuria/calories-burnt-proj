# 🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction

This project uses biometric and workout data to **predict the number of calories burned** during an exercise session using machine learning.

## 📊 Overview

- 🧠 **Goal**: Build a regression model that accurately estimates calories burnt based on factors like age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, duration, and body temperature.
- 💾 **Datasets**:
  - `calories.csv`: Contains the number of calories burnt.
  - `exercise.csv`: Contains user biometric and exercise session data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## 🧪 Features

- Data cleaning and merging
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Correlation heatmaps and distribution plots
- XGBoost model training
- Evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## 📌 Results

- ✅ Model trained with XGBoost Regressor
- 📉 **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: _X.XX_ (fill in once you know your value)
- 🔍 Duration, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature had the strongest correlation with Calories Burnt
